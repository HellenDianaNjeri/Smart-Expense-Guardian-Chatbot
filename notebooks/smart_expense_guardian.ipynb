    "## Project Name\n",
    "**Smart Expense Guardian Chatbot**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The Smart Expense Guardian Chatbot is designed to help individuals, especially small traders and everyday users, track and manage their expenses efficiently. The goal is to provide a simple, interactive, and intelligent assistant that can monitor spending habits, provide insights, and suggest ways to save money through conversational interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Many people struggle with managing their finances due to lack of time, financial literacy, or easy-to-use tools. Small business owners and casual users often rely on manual records, which can be inaccurate and time-consuming. This leads to overspending, missed savings opportunities, and financial stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. **Automated Expense Tracking:** Enable users to record expenses via chat, using text, voice, or photo input.  \n",
    "2. **Categorization & Insights:** Automatically categorize expenses (e.g., food, transport, utilities) and generate visual summaries or alerts.  \n",
    "3. **Spending Analysis:** Identify spending patterns and provide recommendations for better money management.  \n",
    "4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide an intuitive chatbot experience accessible to non-technical users.  \n",
    "5. **Future Scalability:** Lay the foundation for integrating predictive AI features, such as expense forecasting and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Users\n",
    "- Individuals who want to manage personal finances easily.  \n",
    "- Small traders and entrepreneurs needing a simple tool to track business-related expenses.  \n",
    "- People with limited financial literacy seeking guidance in budgeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Value Proposition\n",
    "The chatbot simplifies financial management, saves users time, and helps them make informed decisions to improve savings and reduce unnecessary spending. By providing real-time feedback and interactive insights, it empowers users to take control of their finances without needing complex accounting tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Success Metrics\n",
    "- Number of active users and chat interactions per day.  \n",
    "- Accuracy in expense categorization.  \n",
    "- User satisfaction ratings (via feedback prompts).  \n",
    "- Reduction in untracked or mismanaged expenses reported by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope & Limitations\n",
    "- Initially, the chatbot will focus on basic expense tracking, categorization, and summary insights.  \n",
    "- Predictive analytics and integration with banking APIs can be considered for future versions.  \n",
    "- The chatbot will not provide financial advice or investment recommendations beyond expense management insights.\n"
